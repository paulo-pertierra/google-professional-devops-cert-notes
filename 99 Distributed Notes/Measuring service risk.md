Identify an objective metric.

Sometimes, time-based availability isn't very good, since we may be exposing our service distributed, so fault isolation is harder to do. Instead, we measure in terms of request success rate. **Aggregate availability** shows how yield-based metric is calculated over a rolling window.

availability = successful requests / total requests.

### Identifying the risk tolerance of consumer services

Our consumer services often have a product team that acts as the business owner for an application. For example, Search, Google Maps, and Google Docs each have their own product managers. These product managers are charged with understanding the users and the business, and for shaping the product for success in the marketplace. When a product team exists, that team is usually the best resource to discuss the reliability requirements for a service. In the absence of a dedicated product team, the engineers building the system often play this role either knowingly or unknowingly.

There are many factors to consider when assessing the risk tolerance of services, such as the following:

- What level of availability is required?
- Do different types of failures have different effects on the service?
- How can we use the service cost to help locate a service on the risk continuum?
- What other service metrics are important to take into account?

### Target level of availability

The target level of availability for a given Google service usually depends on the function it provides and how the service is positioned in the marketplace. The following list includes issues to consider:

- What level of service will the users expect?
- Does this service tie directly to revenue (either our revenue, or our customersâ€™ revenue)?
- Is this a paid service, or is it free?
- If there are competitors in the marketplace, what level of service do those competitors provide?
- Is this service targeted at consumers, or at enterprises?
