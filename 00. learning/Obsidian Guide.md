## What to write?
Anything you think is cool, hard to memorize, or hard to **intuit**. 

- H2 for Sub sections or sub-titles (use if single atomic concept or very important)
- H3 for separate concepts/disciplines
- H4 for bulleting links, or important notes, or [[Obsidian Guide#Intuition Check!|Intuition checks]], stuff you think you'll need to backlink later.

#### Always add a H4 for every block, for graph search optimization.

> Stuff you found that are cool, stuff you ask yourself, [[Obsidian Guide#Intuition Check!|Intuition Check!]]
> are in the block quote.


#### Intuition Check!

> Q: What is the format of intuition checks?
> 
> A: This way. It's a question and answer block quote that will try to answer things you're certain you'll be relearning, or struggle to intuit, or generally something hard to learn or master with a few things.

## What not to write?

Do not write anything
- unimportant
- self-explanatory
- easy enough to memorize

Write only **concepts**, trust your brain. You have a flexible memory.

## How to categorize?

No need to stress about it, your categorizations are good enough, there is no need to waste too much time!

## How to organize information?

That's the neat part, you don't! These notes thrive in relationships, and having searchable names. Make sure to create backlinks upon backlinks upon backlinks

> Make as much relationships as possible!

You can tag things at the end of the file!
