## SLI - Service Level Indicators

A carefully selected monitoring metrics that measure one aspect of a service's reliability.

A direct measurement of a service's behavior: frequency of successful probes in the system. 

Close linear relationship to user experience of reliability

Number of good events / Valid events
### SLI Categorization

#### [[The Four Golden Signals]]

## SLO - Service Level Objectives

Combines SLI with target reliability, for example 99.9%, 99.99%, etc..., per month? per year?

SLO should be SMART
- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant
- Time-bound

Should have concrete, well-documented consequences. E.g. reduce rate of change, and more engineering effort towards eliminating risks

## SLA - Service Level Agreement

Minimum level of downtime that is promised to provide to customers. If this agreement is broken, compensate consumers.

Alerting thresholds are **much** higher than minimum documented SLA.

## What should we do?

All parts of the business must agree that this is an accurate measure of *UX*! They should agree that this should be used as a **primary driver for decision making**.
