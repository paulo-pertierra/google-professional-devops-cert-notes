100% reliability is extremely unrealistic. Stability limits innovation, and how quickly products are delivered to users. 

There are factors beyond our control that might even down our 100% reliability, like cell service for customers.

By balancing reliability and rapid innovation, there is more overall user happiness with features, service, and performance.

2 dimensions of cost.
- The cost of redundant machine/compute resources - self explanatory
- The opportunity cost - engineering resources, devs, engineers, etc. etc.

In SRE, we maintain reliability by: **managing risk**. We are in control. We conceptualize risk as a continuum. We also give equal importance between higher reliability, and identifying appropriate level of tolerance.

### Thoughtful Risk Taking

We seek the reliability as a min and a max. If we are not using the error budget, then we are not innovating. If we are falling behind the error budget, we need to divert our decisions to reliability.
